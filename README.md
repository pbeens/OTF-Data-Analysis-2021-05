# OTF-Data-Analysis-2021-05

This repository is for the OTF Data Analysis webinar on May 13, 2021, presented by Peter Beens ([@pbeens](https://twitter.com/pbeens)) and Grant Hutchison ([@grant_hutchison](https://twitter.com/grant_hutchison)).

The presentation is a live demo of Google Colab, Google's implementation of Jupyter Notebook. We will learn how Colab is an excellent tool for the "Compuational Thinking" process, in that it's an ideal way to analyze and document a problem and formulate a programming solution.
