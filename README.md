# OTF-Data-Analysis-2021-05

This repository is for the OTF Data Analysis webinar on May 6, 2021, presented by Peter Beens ([@pbeens](https://twitter.com/pbeens)) and Grant Hutchison ([@grant_hutchison](https://twitter.com/grant_hutchison)).

The presentation is a live demo of Google Colab, Google's implementation of Jupyter Notebook. We will learn how Colab is an excellent tool for the Computational Thinking process, in that it's an ideal way to analyze and document a "problem" and formulate a programming solution.

## Basic Process

- Define the Objective
- Get the Data
- Have a Quick Look at the Data
- Clean/Fix/Filter the Data (if necessary)
- Plot the Data

## Data Sources

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
