In this demo we will create a line chart using a table on the Line Chart page of Wikiedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart>.

The columns of interest are:

- Elapsed Time (s)
- Speed (m s−1)

The titles of the chart will be:

- Elapsed Time (s) (for the x-axis)
- Speed (m/s) (for the y-axis)
- Line Chart Demo (for the main title)
