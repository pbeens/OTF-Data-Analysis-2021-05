# README.md

In this demo we will create a line chart using a table on the Line Chart page of Wikipedia: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_chart>.

The columns of interest are:

- Elapsed Time (s)
- Speed (m s−1)

The titles of the chart will be:

- x-axis: Elapsed Time (s)
- y-axis: Speed (m/s)
- main title: Line Chart Demo
